# FileWarp
(Deprecated, WhatsApp now allows file sending)
This android app is aimed to send files through the messengers that don't allow files to send(one of which is WhatsApp).Through a series of algorithm the selected files are masked by mp3 which then can be sent through the messengers.
The mp3 output from the app is playable so the messengers allow them through.


Advantages
•Any types of files can be sent through the normal messengers.
•No need of creating new accounts or installing other messengers.
•Doesn't increase the file size more than 50kb after masking.
•User friendly UI,has good animations without affecting performance.
•Has internal file browser to select files and initial path can be selected through settings or popup menu in file browser.

•Multiple files can be sent through a single mp3 file.
•App is small in size approximately 1MB.
